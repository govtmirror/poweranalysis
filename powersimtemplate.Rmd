# Overview.

How large of an effect can we detect given our design?  In this handout, we demonstrate a simulation based approach to assessing the power of an experimental design to reject a false null hypothesis.

For a nice overview of the concept of statistical power, see <http://egap.org/methods-guides/10-things-you-need-know-about-statistical-power>. That page also includes a link to a power calculator which can provide quick and reasonable answers to questions about statistical power when you have a simple design and large sample. And you can see an approach to simulation for power analysis there too.^[The direct link to the code for the simulation based approach from that page is here <http://egap.org/content/power-analysis-simulations-r>.]

Right now, this document does not do any power analysis for a cluster-randomized design. We plan to add this. Meanwhile, you can look at this <http://egap.org/methods-guides/10-things-you-need-know-about-cluster-randomization> method guide.


# The Ingredients

Here we talk about each of the different ingredients in a power analysis. The basic idea is to create a fake study that represents your guesses about how the actual study could turn out. Later we wrap these ingredients into one function that you can use to assess different scenarios.

Often you will have data that you can use here: for example, you may know something about the characteristics of units that will receive treatment, or you may already know the subgroups within which you want to ensure equal numbers of treated and control units. You will need to copy this document and edit it in that case. For now, and to keep this document self-contained, we generate fake data.

## Specify Blocks/Design

How will treatment(s) be assigned? Here, just for example, I imagine that we have two groups of individuals, say, men and women, and that we will assign treatment within each group. We will eventually wrap all of these steps together into a function that we can use to assess power/minimum detectable effect given changes in design (such as changes in $N$, changes in blocking structure, etc..).

```{r}
N<-100
female<-rep(c("M","F"),c(ceiling(N/3),N-(ceiling(N/3))))
stopifnot(length(female)==N) ## we should have N units total
stopifnot(all( (table(female) %% 2)==0) ) ## we should have exactly half female and half male
```

Within each block of our imaginary design, we plan to assign half of the observations to treatment and half to control with equal probability.


```{r}
dir.create("libraries")
.libPaths("libraries") ## make the default place for libraries the local one
## install.packages(c("hexbin","xtable","svd","SparseM","abind"))
## download.file("https://github.com/markmfredrickson/RItools/releases/download/rand-dist-v1.0/RItools_0.1-12.tar.gz",destfile="RItools_0.1-12.tar.gz")
install.packages("RItools_0.1-13.tar.gz")
```

```{r}
library(RItools)


## This is a function-maker that will allow us to repeat the experiment.
blockRandomSampler<-function(z,b){
  function(samples){ ## this function assigned treatment within blocks
    zs<-replicate(samples, unsplit(lapply(split(z,b),function(theb){ sample(rep(c(1,0),round(length(theb)/2))) }),b))
    weight<-1 ## this is only useful later
    return(list(weight = weight, samples = zs))
  }
}

## Setup the treatment assignment function using one assignment vector (Z)
set.seed(12345)
Z<-unsplit(lapply(split(rep(NA,N),female),function(b){ sample(rep(c(1,0),round(length(b)/2))) }),female)
treatmentAssigner<-blockRandomSampler(z=Z,b=female)

## produce 10 different treatment assignments. Each should have the same number of men, women, treated and controls
Zs<-treatmentAssigner(10)$samples
tmptab<-table(Z,female)
print(tmptab)
tmp<-apply(Zs,2,function(z){ table(z,female) })
stopifnot(all(tmp[4,]==tmptab[1,2]))
stopifnot(all(tmp[1,]==tmptab[1,1]))

```

## Specify Outcomes

What kind of outcomes do you plan to measure? If you have a version of the outcomes already measured load them here. The key here is to describe the outcome variable as it would look in the control group. Here I'm using a continuous outcome that is correlated with gender.

```{r}
## This next is a binary outcome that is correlated with gender.
### y0<-rbinom(N,prob=c(.4,.8)[as.numeric(female=="F")+1],size=1)
y0<-ifelse(female=="F",runif(sum(female=="F"),min=0, max=10),
	   runif(sum(female!="F"),min=2,max=12))
tapply(y0,female,mean)
```

## What kind of effect do you anticipate?

Here is a simple effect the treatment raises every one by 2:

```{r}
y1<-y0+2
````

What outcome to we see? The treatment assignment chooses whether we see the potential outcome to control, $y_0$, or treatment, $y_1$.

```{r}
Y<- Z*y1 + (1-Z)*y0
```

Create a new dataset.

```{r}
femaleF<-factor(female)
dat<-data.frame(Z=Z,Y=Y,femaleF=femaleF)
```

## Specify the outcome analysis

Will you estimate an average treatment effect? Or test a sharp null hypothesis of no effects? Or something else? Do it here, and make sure it makes sense.

The idea of statistical power requires testing, by the way. So, even if your focus is on estimation, you'll need to have some procedure for creating a confidence interval or $p$-value from a hypothesis test in order to talk about power or minimal detectable effects.

### Testing

The simplest 


### Estimation

If you want to estimate an average treatment effect (ATE) and the

but you have unequal
block sizes, how should you *define* the weighted version of the ATE that you
want? There are two options (1) weighting only by the size of the block or (2)
weighting by both the size of the block and the proportion treated-vs-control
in each block. This last weighting is called "harmonic mean weighting" and it
is the default when you use OLS with fixed effects for blocks (or when you
block-align or block-mean-center the outcome and the treatment assignment).


```{r eval=FALSE}
data(nuclearplants)
xb<-xBalance(pr~t1+strata(ptF),data=nuclearplants,report="all")
xb$results[,"adj.diff",]

unadj<-with(nuclearplants,mean(t1[pr==1])-mean(t1[pr==0]))

res_b<-with(nuclearplants,mapply(function(y,z){
				   c( T=mean(y[z==1]), C=mean(y[z==0]) )
}, y=split(t1,ptF), z=split(pr,ptF)))

trtavg<-mean(nuclearplants$t1[nuclearplants$pr==1])
ctlavg<-mean(nuclearplants$t1[nuclearplants$pr==0])


nb<-table(nuclearplants$pt)
ntrtb<-with(nuclearplants,sapply(split(pr,pt),function(x){ sum(x) }))

sum(res_b*(ntrtb/nb))

sum(res_b*(ntrtb/sum(ntrtb)))


```

```{r}

res_b<-with(dat,mapply(function(y,z){ mean(y[z==1])-mean(y[z==0]) }, y=split(Y,femaleF), z=split(Z,femaleF)))
nb<-table(femaleF)
weighted.mean(res_b,weights=nb)

## A simple estimate of the average treatment effect using a harmonic weighting scheme for unequal block sizes
ate<-lm(Y~Z+femaleF,data=dat)

## A version that does not rely on large-sample assumptions
nullp<-RItest(y=Y,z=Z,test.stat=mean.difference,sample=treatmentAssigner,samples=5000)

## A version that approximates the previous version with a Normal approximation
xb1<-xBalance(Z~Y+strata(femaleF),report="all",data=dat)
nullp2<-xb1$results[,"p",]
ate2<-xb1$results[,"adj.diff",]
xb1$results[,"adj.diff","femaleF"]


```

## Assess Validity of the Tests or Unbiasedness of the Estimation



## Assess Power (given Effect Size)/Minimum Detectable Effect Size (given Power)

If we test the "truth" then we can assess the validity of the tests and/or unbiasedness of the estimation method.

```{r}

newY<-y0 ## make truth zero
Zs<-treatmentAssigner(1000)
ALTS<-sort(unique(c(0,seq(-3,3,length=100))))



```


## What to do if you want to block on many covariates? Or if you want to create pairs based on one covariate?

Try the `blockTools` package in R, especially the non-bipartite matching option.
